Developed in Python 3.85 in Ubuntu WSL.
Requires Python 3.6+ (many f"{f-strings}" ).

Only standard library imports, so requirements.txt would be blank!

usage:
    calling 
    "$ python3 solution.py basket.csv"

will produce a report on the fruit inventory including these metrics:

1. Total number of fruit
2. Total types of fruit
3. The number of each type of fruit in descending order
4. The characteristics (size, color, shape, etc.) of each fruit by type
5. Have any fruit been in the basket for over 3 days

Can trim, refactor, add features to the script on request, happy to discuss.
